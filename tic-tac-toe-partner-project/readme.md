# Tic-Tac-Toe


<p>This project aims to recreate the game of tic-tac-toe within Python.</p>
<br>

## Instructions
---
<br>
<p>Make sure art.py, opponent.py, render.py and TicTacToeV5.py are in the same directory.</p>
<p>Start the game by executing the TicTacToeV5 file.</p>
<p>On starting the application, enter any keypress to start the game.</p>
<p>The game board will be drawn. If the computer was chosen to go first, you'll see that an <strong>O</strong> has already been placed. Rows are marked by numbers and columns are marked by letters.</p> 
<p>To make a move, you'll first be asked to enter a column ID, followed by a row ID. Afterward your move will be registered to the board.</p>
<p>You and the computer take turns until someone wins or there are no moves left to make. The game will then exit to the menu where you can see your session stats.</p>
<br>
