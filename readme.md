## Welcome!

This repo hosts a collection of projects as I learn the ins and outs of Python. Many of these apps are inspired by https://100daysofpython.dev/, which has been an excellent resource for generating ideas and practicing through the development of bite-sized, feature-complete programs. Below are a few highlighted projects that I've found interesting, and I'll occasionally update this document as I continue on my journey.

Place your bets and play a game of blackjack against the dealer. It uses a finite deck of cards and gives the player some customization options, such as adjusting table limits or the number of decks used. The biggest hassle was getting the card strings to print properly, since this is CLI-only.
