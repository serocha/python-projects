## Welcome!

This repo hosts a collection of projects as I learn the ins and outs of Python.

Many of these apps are inspired by [100 Days of Python](https://100daysofpython.dev/), which has been an excellent resource for practicing through bite-sized, feature-complete programs. 

Below are a few highlighted projects that I've found interesting.



## Blackjack

![Blackjack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serocha/python-projects/main/imgs/blackjack.png)

Place your bets and play a game of blackjack against the dealer.

This project uses a finite deck of cards, and gives the player some customization options such as adjusting table limits or the number of decks used. The biggest hassle was getting the card strings to print properly since this uses a CLI.
