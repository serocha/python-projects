# Welcome!

This repo hosts a collection of bite-sized, feature-complete projects I've made using Python, many of which were [inspired by 100 Days of Python](https://100daysofpython.dev/). I'll update this periodically as I add new projects.
<p>Below are a few highlighted projects.</p>

## Blackjack

<p>Practice your card-counting skills and try to grow your earnings in a game of blackjack against the dealer. This project uses a finite deck of cards, and the player can customize how many decks are used. The biggest challenge was in getting the card strings to print properly, as this is CLI-based.</p>

## Treasure Island

<p>Explore an ominous island and see if you can survive. The game is an unfinished proof-of-concept as it lacks ending locations, but I really enjoyed making it. Adding more content is relatively straightforward, so I'll see about revisiting the project when I have time.</p>
