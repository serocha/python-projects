# Welcome!

<p>This repo hosts a collection of bite-sized, feature-complete projects I've made using Python, many of which were [inspired by 100 Days of Python](https://100daysofpython.dev/).</p>
<p>Below are a few highlighted projects, and I'll try to update this list periodically.</p>
<br>

## Blackjack

<p>Place your bets!</p>
<p>Practice your card-counting skills and try to grow your earnings in a game of blackjack against the dealer. This project uses a finite deck of cards, and the player can customize how many decks are used. The biggest challenge was in getting the card strings to print properly, as this is CLI-based.</p>

## Treasure Island

<p>Choose your own adventure.</p>
<p>Explore an ominous island and see if you can survive. The game is an unfinished proof-of-concept as it lacks ending locations, but I really enjoyed making it. Adding more content is relatively straightforward, so I'll see about revisiting the project when I have time. This was my first attempt at designing a map that the player can traverse, and it taught me some good lessons on managing objects.</p>
